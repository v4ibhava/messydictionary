# Messy Dictionary 📖

Messy Dictionary is a **fun, community-driven slang dictionary** where people can add and explore **local, regional, or informal words** that are usually not found in traditional dictionaries.

This project is meant to be **playful and open**, focusing on real-world language, street slang, regional phrases, and inside jokes used in specific areas.

## ✨ What is this project?

Instead of being a strict academic dictionary, Messy Dictionary is a **parody-style dictionary** where:

- Anyone can add a word
- Definitions can be informal or humorous

Think of it as a place to document the words people *actually use* in daily life.
